//! Pure logic for the Clawdmeter desktop daemon.
//!
//! Nothing in here talks to Bluetooth or draws a window. The modules:
//!
//! * [`paths`], [`config`]: the shared state dir (`~/.config/clawdmeter`) and its files.
//! * [`usage`]: run and parse `claude --output-format json -p /usage`.
//! * [`oauth`]: usage from Claude's usage endpoint with Claude Code's stored sign-in.
//! * [`probe`]: usage from one message's rate-limit headers, and when that is allowed.
//! * [`events`]: the hook events log (fast clock) and the activity tracker.
//! * [`attention`]: the attention hook's alert / clear files (written by
//!   `clawdmeter hook`; the installer lives in the app crate).
//! * [`cadence`]: when to poll, when to heartbeat.
//! * [`backoff`]: how long an account waits after a failed poll.
//! * [`selector`]: which account to show.
//! * [`payload`]: the JSON the firmware parses.
//! * [`rate`]: the slow-clock mood.
//! * [`engine`]: all of the above as one I/O-free state machine.
//! * [`feeds`]: what the device's extra pages share (refresh [`feeds::Schedule`],
//!   ASCII fold, HTTP), and each page's own write: [`weather`] (Open-Meteo),
//!   [`pace`] (usage history), [`activity`] (Claude Code transcripts),
//!   [`service_status`] (status.claude.com), [`system`] (host stats, Linux)
//!   and [`stocks`] (Yahoo Finance).
//! * [`autostart`], [`launch`], [`platform`]: start-at-login, the path to
//!   launch the app by, and host queries.
